### What Is Unfinished...
---
* CSS and styling work
* "Game Over" isn't completely working as intended
* Glitch with the paddle and ball - the ball will occasionally travel along the top or bottom of the paddle before "bouncing"
* The paddle strike location should effect the x-trajectory of the ball (left/middle/right).
* Timer component to complete the level

### Future Expansions
---
* Add additional levels - the code was written with this in mind so the scoring, brick array, ball speed and paddle speed can be easily adjusted based on the level.
* Add sounds for ball bounce, brick break, paddle bounce
* Keep session high score attained.
* Add additional obsticles to game such as bricks that need to be strick 2/3 times, etc.
